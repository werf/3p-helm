## helm delete

given a release name, delete the release from Kubernetes

### Synopsis



This command takes a release name, and then deletes the release from Kubernetes.
It removes all of the resources associated with the last release of the chart.

Use the '--dry-run' flag to see which releases will be deleted without actually
deleting them.


```
helm delete [flags] RELEASE_NAME [...]
```

### Options

```
      --dry-run    simulate a delete
      --no-hooks   prevent hooks from running during deletion
      --purge      remove the release from the store and make its name free for later use
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --debug                 enable verbose output
      --home string           location of your Helm config. Overrides $HELM_HOME (default "/Users/mattbutcher/Code/helm_home")
      --host string           address of tiller. Overrides $HELM_HOST

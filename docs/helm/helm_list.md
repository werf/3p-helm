## helm list

list releases

### Synopsis


This command lists all of the releases.

By default, it lists only releases that are deployed or failed. Flags like
'--uninstalled' and '--all' will alter this behavior. Such flags can be combined:
'--uninstalled --failed'.

By default, items are sorted alphabetically. Use the '-d' flag to sort by
release date.

If the --filter flag is provided, it will be treated as a filter. Filters are
regular expressions (Perl compatible) that are applied to the list of releases.
Only items that match the filter will be returned.

	$ helm list --filter 'ara[a-z]+'
	NAME            	UPDATED                 	CHART
	maudlin-arachnid	Mon May  9 16:07:08 2016	alpine-0.1.0

If no results are found, 'helm list' will exit 0, but with no output (or in
the case of no '-q' flag, only headers).

By default, up to 256 items may be returned. To limit this, use the '--max' flag.
Setting '--max' to 0 will not return all results. Rather, it will return the
server's default, which may be much higher than 256. Pairing the '--max'
flag with the '--offset' flag allows you to page through results.

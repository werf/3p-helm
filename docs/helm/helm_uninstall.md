## helm uninstall

given a release name, uninstall the release from Kubernetes

### Synopsis


This command takes a release name, and then uninstalls the release from Kubernetes.
It removes all of the resources associated with the last release of the chart.

Use the '--dry-run' flag to see which releases will be uninstalled without actually
uninstalling them.


```
helm uninstall RELEASE_NAME [...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --dry-run       simulate a uninstall
  -h, --help          help for uninstall
      --no-hooks      prevent hooks from running during uninstallation
      --purge         remove the release from the store and make its name free for later use
      --timeout int   time in seconds to wait for any individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks) (default 300)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --debug                 enable verbose output
      --home string           location of your Helm config. Overrides $HELM_HOME (default "~/.helm")
      --kube-context string   name of the kubeconfig context to use
      --kubeconfig string     path to the kubeconfig file

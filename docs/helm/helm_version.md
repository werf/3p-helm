## helm version

print the client/server version information

### Synopsis



Show the client and server versions for Helm and tiller.

This will print a representation of the client and server versions of Helm and
Tiller. The output will look something like this:

Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.0.0-beta.1", GitCommit:"ff52399e51bb880526e9cd0ed8386f6433b74da1", GitTreeState:"dirty"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.0.0-beta.1", GitCommit:"b0c113dfb9f612a9add796549da66c0d294508a3", GitTreeState:"clean"}

- SemVer is the semantic version of the release.
- GitCommit is the SHA for the commit that this version was built from.
- GitTreeState is "clean" if there are no local code changes when this binary was
  built, and "dirty" if the binary was built from locally modified code.

To print just the client version, use '--client'. To print just the server version,
use '--server'.
